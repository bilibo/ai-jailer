# Changelog

Dated entries, newest first. The roadmap says what is next; this says what
happened and what was learned on the day.

## 2026-10-20

- Unmanaged Fedora host: `scripts/bootstrap-fedora.sh` (Fedora 44's own
  `nix` and `nix-daemon` packages; direnv, devenv and ccmux from the
  flake's new `packages.direnv` and `packages.devenv`; the home module's
  configuration as plain files; `--check` as the host doctor; `--upgrade`;
  `--reset`), `scripts/init-repo.sh` (runbook section 3, including the two
  `direnv allow`s a new repo needs), `scripts/live-check.sh` (section 5's
  live cases, judged on transcripts and files).
- Two host findings, fixed in the bootstrap script: SELinux gives `/nix`
  `default_t` and the daemon socket directory needs `var_run_t`; Fedora 44
  has no legacy `ca-bundle.crt` paths, so `NIX_SSL_CERT_FILE` must name
  `/etc/pki/ca-trust/extracted/pem/tls-ca-bundle.pem`.
- From zero on the Fedora laptop, end to end: `init-repo.sh raul/harness-test`
  wrote the repo file (settings checks and 154 hook cases passing),
  `nix flake check` passed on the host, `live-check.sh` 10/10 against `-p`
  sessions, with the hook, a permission rule and the sandbox each seen
  refusing. First time a real session ran on the repo file alone.
- Sandbox audit against the sandboxing docs and live: reads open except
  `denyRead`, glob `denyWrite` entries skipped on Linux (confirmed with a
  `mkdir` inside the sandbox), network prompt-gated without
  `strictAllowlist`, every unix socket reachable, environment inherited.
  Recorded in runbook section 8 and ordered in the roadmap.
- Account connectors off in harness repos: `disableClaudeAiConnectors`
  holds from the repo file (any scope), `harness.allowConnectors` opts a
  repo back in; `project-settings-test` asserts it (15 checks).
- Verified against the Claude Code docs (2.1.304): the Notification
  matcher names, FileChanged's literal-basename matcher, `--debug-file`,
  `claude doctor`, the scopes of `disableClaudeAiConnectors`,
  `syncClaudeAiSkills`, `syncClaudeAiPlugins`, `deniedMcpServers` and
  `blockReadsOutsideWorkingDirectories`.
- Installer survey (azd, Determinate nix-installer, rustup, uv) and the
  resulting design for one `harness` CLI: roadmap item 3.
- Docs reworked to the Fedora reality: README opening, host table, a
  "Lockdown level today" table; runbook sections 3 to 6 and 8; the
  handoff's inventory; this file.
- First cross-session case live: a customer session's refused edit to
  `devenv/devenv.nix` relayed as a diff to the platform session, which
  asked Raul before applying. Written up as `docs/sessions.md`: identity
  from the host, the human as the only gate, a proposal flow, and the
  broker mod in three stages (observe, propose, gate); roadmap item 9
  reworded to match.

## 2026-10-18

- Repo-only shape: one settings body for the managed and the repo copy,
  the devenv module writes hooks and sandbox too, the hook blocks
  `settings.local.json` changes and nested `claude` launch flags,
  `project-settings-test` in `nix flake check`. An unmanaged host needs no
  host modules; the managed layer is the managed-host shape.
- `ccmux` replaces `ccode` (the old name stays as a second entry point).
- `docs/handoff-tiers.md` written from an inventory of this repo,
  `~/nixos-config` and the Claude Code 2.1.296 docs.

## 2026-10-17

- Own repo with a `flake.nix` exporting `nixosModules.harness`,
  `homeModules.harness`, `lib`, the managed trees as packages and the tests
  as `checks`.
- Verified against a real project repo (Azure Functions, Rust).
- Hook gaps compared with Hermes Agent, Codex, destructive_command_guard
  and codex-protect; the text-matching gaps accepted and listed in runbook
  section 8.
